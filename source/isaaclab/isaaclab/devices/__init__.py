"""Sub-package providing interfaces to different teleoperation devices.

Currently, the following categories of devices are supported:

* **OpenXR**: Uses hand tracking of index/thumb tip avg to drive the target pose. Gripping is done with pinching.
* **Haply**: Haptic device (Inverse3 + VerseGrip) with position, orientation tracking and force feedback.

Keyboard, gamepad, and spacemouse teleoperation (SE(2)/SE(3)) is provided by
:mod:`isaaclab_teleop.keyboard`, :mod:`isaaclab_teleop.gamepad`, and :mod:`isaaclab_teleop.spacemouse`,
built on the IsaacTeleop session API.

All device interfaces inherit from the :class:`DeviceBase` class, which provides a
common interface for all devices. The device interface reads the input data when
the :meth:`DeviceBase.advance` method is called. It also provides the function :meth:`DeviceBase.add_callback`
to add user-defined callback functions to be called when a particular input is pressed from
the peripheral device.
